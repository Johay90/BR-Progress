      <h1 id="header">My Wartune Progress</h1>
      <p id="header">This website is personal website to keep track of my progress on a Browser Turn based MMO game called Wartune. It has something called "Battle Rating" which in essence is your "toons score" ie. Your combined gear score, your pets score etc. I want to track this on a day by day basis to see how I'm upgrading.</p>
